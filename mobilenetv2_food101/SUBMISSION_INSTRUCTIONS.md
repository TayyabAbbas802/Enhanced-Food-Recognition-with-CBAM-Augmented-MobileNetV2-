# 📤 Research Paper Submission Guide

This guide details exactly **how** and **where** to submit your paper titled *"Efficient Food Recognition with CBAM-Enhanced MobileNetV2"*.

---

## ✅ Step 0: Pre-Submission Checklist

Before you submit anywhere, ensure you have:
1.  **The "Source"**: Your paper text (from `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`).
2.  **The Figures**: High-quality images of your architecture and graphs.
3.  **The Code**: Your GitHub repository link (make sure it's public).
4.  **The Account**: An academic email address (e.g., `.edu`) is highly recommended for faster validation.

## 🚀 Option A: Submit to arXiv (Recommended First Step)

**Why**: verifiable proof of your work, citable immediately, free.

1.  **Register/Login**: Go to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/login) and create an account.
2.  **Start New Submission**:
    *   **Agreement**: Accept the license (most choose "arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license").
    *   **Subject Class**: Choose `Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)`.
3.  **Upload Files**:
    *   arXiv prefers **LaTeX**.
    *   **Action**: Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), use the "arXiv Template", paste your text from `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`, and export the project as a `.zip` file. Upload this zip to arXiv.
    *   *Alternative*: You can upload a PDF directly, but LaTeX is preferred.
4.  **Metadata**:
    *   **Title**: Efficient Food Recognition with CBAM-Enhanced MobileNetV2
    *   **Abstract**: Paste your abstract.
    *   **Authors**: [Your Name]
5.  **Preview & Submit**: The system will build a PDF. Check it carefully. Click "Submit".
    *   *Timing*: It takes 24-48 hours to appear online.

## 🏆 Option B: Submit to a Conference/Journal

**Target**: **IEEE Access** (Journal) or **WACV / CVPR Workshops** (Conference).

### 1. IEEE Access (Fast Journal)
*   **Format**: Use the [IEEE Template](https://template-selector.ieee.org/secure/templateSelector/publicationType).
*   **System**: Submissions go through [ScholarOne Manuscripts](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ieee-access).
*   **Process**:
    1.  Create an account.
    2.  "Start New Submission".
    3.  Upload your PDF and Source Files (LaTeX/Word).
    4.  Enter keywords (Food Recognition, Deep Learning).
    5.  Suggest Reviewers (Optional).
*   **Cost**: Open Access fee applies ($1,950) *only if accepted*.

### 2. Workshops (e.g., CVPR ECV)
*   **Format**: Use the [CVPR LaTeX Template](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit).
*   **System**: Usually [CMT (Microsoft Conference Management Toolkit)](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/) or [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/).
*   **Process**:
    1.  Find the specific workshop website (search "CVPR 2025 Workshops").
    2.  Click "Submit Paper".
    3.  Upload your PDF (anonymized if double-blind review).
    4.  Enter conflicts of interest (domain names).

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting: The "Endorsement" Requirement

If arXiv asks for an **Endorsement** for `cs.CV`:
1.  **Don't Panic**: This is normal for first-time submitters. It prevents spam.
2.  **Who can endorse?**: Professors at your university (`iqraisb.edu.pk`) who have published on arXiv in Computer Vision.
3.  **Action**: Forward the email arXiv sent you to a professor in your CS department and ask kindly: *"Professor, I have written a paper on efficient food recognition. Would you be willing to endorse me for the cs.CV category on arXiv?"*

## 🔓 Option C: Immediate Alternatives (No Endorsement Needed)

If you cannot find an endorser quickly but want to **prove your work immediately**:

### 1. Zenodo (Recommended)
*   **Website**: [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org)
*   **Pros**: Gives you a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier) instantly. Citable. Owned by CERN.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Sign up (GitHub login works).
    2.  Click "New Upload".
    3.  Upload your PDF (from the zip or compiled locally).
    4.  Title: "Efficient Food Recognition..."
    5.  Publish.

### 2. ResearchGate
*   Create a profile and upload your "Preprint".

*Note: You can submit to Zenodo NOW and to arXiv LATER when you find an endorser.*

## 🛠️ How to Format (Using Overleaf)

Academic papers **must** look standard. Do not submit a Word doc unless allowed.

1.  Go to [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com).
2.  Click **New Project** -> **Academic Journal Template**.
3.  Search for "IEEE" or "CVPR".
4.  Open the template.
5.  **Paste content**: Copy sections from `RESEARCH_PAPER.md` into the `.tex` file chapters.
    *   Replace `\section{Introduction}` with your text.
    *   Use `\begin{table}...\end{table}` for your results table.
6.  **Download PDF**: Click "Recompile" -> "Download PDF".

## 💡 Pro Tips

*   **GitHub Link**: Put your GitHub repo link in the abstract or introduction. "Code is available at: github.com/..."
*   **Cover Letter**: If submitting to a journal, write a simple cover letter: *"Dear Editor, we submit this manuscript describing a novel lightweight food recognition model..."*
*   **Double-Blind**: CAUTION! Many conferences (CVPR, ECCV) are "double-blind". This means **do not write your name** in the PDF. Use "Anonymous Authors". Camera-ready (final) versions will add your name later.

**Ready?** Start with **arXiv**. It's the easiest win.
